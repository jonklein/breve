<hr><h5>version 1.3 [12/05/2001]</h5>
<p>
<h5><b>Important change for users of previous versions:</b></h5>
<p>
The default iteration and integration timesteps have been changed.
<blockquote>
Control.tz has changed the default timesteps and integration steps to match
  the timesteps used by PhysicalControl.tz.  This way, objects from regular 
  simulations will behave the same way in physical simulations.
<p>
  Simulations written in previous versions will run very slowly because of the 
  small timesteps.  You should increase the velocities of the objects so that they
  run at a reasonable speed.
<p>
  If you need to return to the old step sizes, you can set the integration step
  to 0.5 and the iteration step to 3.0.  For new simulations, however, you 
  should use the default values.

  A number of demos have been modified to accommodate this change.
</blockquote>
<p>
<h5><b>General changes:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Major bug fixes and improvements to physics engine.
<LI>Major speed optimizations.
<LI>Support added for plug-ins.
<LI>slURLPlugin allows URLs to be download and web pages to be opened from within simulations.

</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>Changes to the steve language:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Added "notifications".  Instances can now register for notifications from other
  instances.  This allows special actions to automatically be called for all 
  observing instances.  See documentation for Object.tz for more information.
</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>Changes to the application interface:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Improved preferences dialog box with many new options.
<LI>Syntax coloring!
<LI>Editor window can now check for matching braces and parentheses.
<LI>Auto indent.
<LI>Recent menu now preserved every time <b>breve</b> is run.
</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>
Changes to the included <b>breve</b> class files:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>New "system" method of Control.tz allows shell commands to be executed from within simulations.
<LI>New "copy" method in Data.tz allows the contents of one data subclass to be copied into another.
<LI>New "pause" method in Control.tz allows the simulation to pause itself as though the user had clicked on the pause button.
<LI>Introductory networking support.
</ul>
<p>
<hr><h5>version 1.2 [10/08/2001]</h5>
<p>
<h5><b>General changes:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>New "tips &amp; techniques" documentation describes how to use many of 
 <b>breve</b>'s features which are part of the included class hierarchy.  Accessible
 from the Help menu.
<LI>Demo simulations updated and enhanced.
<LI>Added "Check Syntax" option from the Edit menu to check the syntax of a simulation without running it.
<LI><b>breve</b> now allows graphic files (in SGI format) to be loaded and used as textures or "billboards". 
<LI>Improved rendering&mdash;adds the ability to render shadows and reflections of objects on to a floor.
<LI>Text strings can now be printed in the simulation display.
<LI>Added "neighbor checking", a fast and sophisticated method of finding 
 objects within a certain range.  This represents a huge speed improvement
 on many simulations which previously checked the location of every other 
 object manually.
<LI>Fixed movie &amp; snapshot export bug which caused corrupted images on 
 some systems.
<LI>Added settings for quality and simulation frames per second during movie
 export.
<LI>Added contextual menu support for objects in the simulation&mdash;actions can
 be assigned on a per-object basis.  Hold down control while clicking on 
 objects in the simulation to see the menu.
<LI>Improved menu support in <I>steve</I>, such that menus can be disabled/enabled, unchecked/checked from within simulations.
<LI>Added dialog box support to get ok/cancel type input from within simulations.
<LI>Documentation updated.
<LI>Improved error reporting.
<LI>Additional optimization over 1.1. 
<LI>Potential memory leaks fixed with improved garbage collection in steve.
</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>Changes to the application interface:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Added "New From Template" menu item to create a new document with a simulation template.
<LI>Added "Open Recent" submenu from the file menu.
</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>Changes to the steve language:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Added support for perl-like embedding of simple variables in strings, such as
 print "my value is $self".  This does not work for arrays or lists at this time.
<LI>"Controller" line can now be punctuated with "." in addition to ";", in order to
 stay consistent with the rest of the steve language.
<LI>The variable "controller" defined in the Object.tz class points to the controller
 instance for the simulation.  As Object.tz is the root class, the expression 
 controller is universally defined. 
</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>Changes to the included <b>breve</b> class files:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Many new features.
<LI>Class Object.tz stores the "controller" instance in a variable called "controller". 
 This means that every object in the simulation now has direct access to its 
 controller object. 
<LI>Made Stationary.tz and Mobile.tz subclasses of a new class, Real.tz.  Real.tz
 is the logical opposite of Abstract.tz and serves as a parent class to all "real" 
 objects in the simulation world.
</ul>
<p>
<hr><h5>version 1.1 [07/16/2001]</h5>
<p>
<h5><b>VERY IMPORTANT CHANGE AFFECTING SIMULATIONS WRITTEN WITH VERSION 1.0:</b></h5>
<blockquote>
The "scale" of the world has now been fixed at "1 world unit" = 1 meter.  The world is now effectively 1/10th the size of the world in version 1.0.
<p>
If you are using the class PhysicalControl </b>then you will probably want to scale down the objects in your simulation to 1/10th of their original size.  1 unit in the simulated world is now fixed as 1 meter.  This means that objects created in version 1.0 may now be much larger than intended.  You should modify your simulation to scale down every object to 1/10th of the original size and modify the forces applied to objects and joints; the accelerations, speeds and positions of the objects and the camera locations accordingly.
<p>
Bear in mind when adjusting forces applied to objects and joints that the mass of the object will not scale down by 1/10th but instead much more&mdash;in the case of a rectangular solid, the mass is scaled by a factor of 1/100th.  This means that maximum joint pressures should most likely be scaled down by <I>at least </I>100.
<p>
<b>If you are not using the class PhysicalControl</b> then the only effect of the changes will be that the textures on objects are very small and that the default starting camera position may be closer than desired.  You can fix these problems by following the same directions given above for those using the class PhysicalControl.
</blockquote>
<p>
<h5><b>General changes:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Fixed display bug on systems without Mac OS X OpenGL hardware 
  acceleration.  </b>This bug caused the simulation to not display on certain 
  Macs including first generation iMacs and some iBooks, rendering the 
  software useless on these machines.
<LI>many significant speed optimizations made.
<LI>new "Walker" demo shows evolution of walking behavior.
<LI>added ability to save still images from simulations.
<LI>added very <I>basic</I> support for exporting QuickTime movies. 
<LI>added the ability to select objects and browse their variables. 
<LI>improved rendering.
<LI>added control for lighting.
<LI>fixed possible freeze bug associated with log window.
<LI>many small bugs fixed.
</ul>
<h5><b>Changes to the included <b>breve</b> class files:
</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>new Data class allows instances to be saved to disk and 
 loaded next time the simulation is run, allowing key states of 
 simulations to be saved [experimental].  See the documentation 
 for the class Data.tz for more information.
</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>Changes to the steve language:</b></h5>
<ul>
<LI>added support for basic arrays
<LI>list support greatly improved.
<LI><I>push</I>, <I>pop</I> and <I>sort</I> are now reserved keywords in steve.
<LI>calling a method in a freed instance is now an error which will 
 stop a simulation.  previously calling a method in a freed 
 instance was simply ignored.
<LI>testing the truth value of a freed instance returns 0.  previously a freed object had a truth value of 1.
</ul>
<p>
<h5><b>Changes to physical simulation:</b></h5>
<p>
<ul>
<LI>some bugs fixed.
<LI>some bugs remain.
